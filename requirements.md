# Requirements

## 1. Basic Chatbot functionality

We will be using the matrix-nio library to handle the basic chatbot functionality. This library offers a high-level API for interacting with the Matrix protocol. It allows us to create a bot that can join rooms, read and send messages, and interact with users in other ways.

## 2. Homeserver

For the bot to function, we need a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver is the server-side component of the Matrix protocol. It stores users' chat history and metadata, handles message routing, and more. We will build our own homeserver to ensure we have full control over the bot's data and interactions.

## 3. Protocol functionality

To facilitate the bot's role in writing meeting minutes, we need to set up some additional protocol functionality. This may include commands for the bot to start and stop recording minutes, ways to highlight important points for inclusion in the minutes, and methods to retrieve the final minutes document.

## 4. Multiple Sources

In addition to Matrix, we want the bot to be able to interact with multiple other sources. These include E-Mail, WhatsApp, Element, Discord, and Slack. This will involve setting up integrations with each of these platforms, allowing the bot to read and send messages in a consistent way across all of them.

## 5. Language Learning Model (LLM)

To help the bot understand and generate text, we will incorporate an open source language learning model. We are considering using LangChain or Pinecone, both of which offer powerful natural language understanding capabilities. We will need to ensure that the LLM has access to a sufficiently large and diverse dataset to train on, and that it can be integrated into the bot's message processing pipeline.
